# [@magic](https://magic.github.io)

magic is a module based generator for interactive clients, apis and static pages.

this is also called a [jamstack](https://jamstack.org/), javascript, apis and markup.

less than 15kb of html + css + javascript boilerplate means @magic is minimal,
and the module based approach means that it is also easily extendable and customizable.

by creating html, css and javascript files,
@magic makes sure that your pages load as quickly as possible,
and your app will stay usable without javascript.
